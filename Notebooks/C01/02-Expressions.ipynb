    "Last lecture we talked about the three numeric types included in base Python. Those being, `int`, `float`, and `complex()`. We saw that all of these numeric types implement the six basic arithmetic operations `+`, `*`, `**`, `/`, `//`, and `%`. Today, we will talk a bit more about floating point numbers and will briefly discuss *floating point error*. "
