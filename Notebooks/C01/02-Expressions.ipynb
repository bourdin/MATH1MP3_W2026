    "Last lecture we talked about the three numeric types included in base Python. Those being, `int`, `float`, and `complex()`. We saw that all of these numeric types implement the six basic arithmetic operations `+`, `*`, `**`, `/`, `//`, and `%`. Today, we will talk a bit more about floating point numbers and will briefly discuss *floating point error*. "

Python will automatically infer the type of an object from its value. However, we may sometimes want to force a given object to have a particular type. We can do this with *type casting* (using the name of a type as a function i.e  `int()`, `float()`, `str()` etc.) However, this can sometimes have unwanted consequences. For instance, `int(54.7)` will return the integer `54` instead of `55` even though `55` is the nearer integer (this is called truncation).\n",
